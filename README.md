# Matplotlib Starter Solo Project 
### A repo made to test out matplotlib's tools and install the packages needed to learn what it's about.

### Things learned:
* Learned how to update matploblit in live time using Vscode's interactive terminal. 
* Combine my math knowledge with matplotlib.
* Sharpened my math skills!

### Overall, a productive project which allowed for better understanding of matplotlib's pylab graphs.

## Preview of work done:
